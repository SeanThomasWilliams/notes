Notebook
-----

- Everybody is using this for work and presentations. It is amazing.
- Python, scipy, graphs, pictures, videos, etc all in your web browser.
- Easily convert your session into a web page/presentation.
- Interacts with Pandas (the Pandas guy loves this as well).
- Inline figures
- Detects segfaults. You can restart your kernel and keep your work.
- Great for trying out snippets from the web, even with >>> formatting.

Parallel Computing Framework
-----

- IPython gives you a high level parallel computing framework.
- This was touched upon lightly, but it looks promising.
- Recommend looking into this more.
