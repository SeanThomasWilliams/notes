Startup Ideas
-----

- Create a search engine that hackers want to use

  - Google has become bloated
  - An interface that allows for the best search should do well

- Replace E-mail

  - Email had turned into a todo list
  - Make people jump through hoops to put something on my todo list
  - It has no way of structuring content or showing what is really important

- Replace Universities

  - PyCon is an example
  - Four years of school doesn't really work anymore
  - Universities aren't keeping up with today's world

- Kill Hollywood

  - Find a way to distribute drama over the internet
  - People still want to be entertained and watch a story unfold
  - Youtube clips don't cut it
  - TVs are horrible interfaces

- Kill Apple

  - A visionary can't lead a company his direction unless he started it
  - Can't innovate without Steve Jobs

- Bring back the old Moore's law

  - The law states that circuits would get 2x dense, not 2x faster
  - You used to just wait for the next generation of processors rather than refactor code
  - Design a sufficiently smart compiler
  - Build programs out of parallelizable blocks (MapReduce type) 
  - Make many CPUs behave like one so the programmer doesn't have to think about it

- Ongoing Diagnosis

  - Why do we have to wait until we get sick in order to find out we have something wrong with us?
  - "Incidentalomas": Things we find by doing scans that wouldn't otherwise bother us
  - Lots of false alarms
  - Have to fight red tape of medical industry

- Don't attack the huge problems head-on
- Start small and iterate
