Startup Ideas

#. Create a search engine that hackers want to use

  - Google has become bloated
  - An interface that allows for the best search should do well

#. Replace E-mail

  - Email had turned into a todo list
  - Make people jump through hoops to put something on my todo list
  - It has no way of structuring content or showing what is really important

#. Replace Universities

  - PyCon is an example
  - Four years of school doesn't really work anymore
  - Universities aren't keeping up with today's world

#. Kill Hollywood

  - Find a way to distribute drama over the internet
  - People still want to be entertained and watch a story unfold
  - Youtube clips don't cut it
  - TVs are horrible interfaces

#. Kill Apple


#. Bring back the old Moore's law


#. Ongoing Diagnosis
