General Conference Notes from PyCon 2012
=====

- I was the first one to complete Google's 5-pin python challenge, which involved solving python puzzles and finding clues. Yay for me.
- In the sessions, the chairs are very crammed together. No elbow room!
- The first day, my laptop didn't hold out for long without battery power AND I forgot my charger.
- PyCon was nice enough to provide 20 port power strips on many rows (if you get the right seat).
- I should be able to note throughout saturday and for what is left on Sunday.

Company tips for next time
=====

- We had BY FAR the best Tchotchkes at the event (most other people gave away shirts, water bottles, etc). Nobody had seen the reversable sphere gizmos and that was a good conversation starter.
- Need QR codes on everything. Nobody wants to take our resume-looking sheets of paper. A QR code that goes to the same information would have faired better.
- Everyone has a smartphone. Let's take advantage of it.
- People remember our company (and toys) from last year!
- Create a cool challenge for developers. Google had a cool idea where they rewarded pins for solving their challenges. At the end, you also get a shirt.
- Have something interactive to demo. It is difficult to describe the multitude of things we do.
- We had to pay in order to get Internet in the hotel rooms. It was more than I was willing to pay.
