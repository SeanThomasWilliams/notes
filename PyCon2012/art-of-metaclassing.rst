Metaclasses
=====

Note: The door for 'graph processing in python' was closed and locked when I got there

- Metaclasses inherit from 'type'

- When to use metaclasses?
  - Developer to declare an api/interface of classes or subclessses according to one specification, but internally provide more functionality when classes are created

- Useful for making concreate classes more straight forward

Programmatic Class Creation
---------------------------

- Metaclasses aren't always the right answer
- You can create classes programmatically in a function
- This function is a class factoryv
- When there is an aspect of class creating that you can't know until execution time
- If you're not sure if you should use one, do some more research
