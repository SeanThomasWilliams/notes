Metaclasses
=====

metaclasses inherit from 'type'

When to use metaclasses?
Developer to declare an api/interface of classes or subclessses according to one specification, but internally provide more functionality when classes are created

- Useful for making concreate classes more straight forward

- Metaclasses aren't always the right answer
- You can create classes programmatically in a function
- This function is a class factoryv
- When there is an aspect of class creating that you can't know until execution time
